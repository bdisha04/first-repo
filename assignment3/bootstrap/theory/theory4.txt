1. How modals and carousels work in Bootstrap?

Modal

A modal is a pop-up box that shows information or a form without leaving the page.

Example: A "Contact Me" form that appears when you click a button.

It works using Bootstrap’s JavaScript and special attributes like data-bs-toggle="modal".


Carousel

A carousel is a slideshow of images or content.

Example: An image slider that automatically changes every few seconds.

It works using Bootstrap’s carousel component, where you add images inside .carousel-item.

You can also add arrows or dots to move between slides.
