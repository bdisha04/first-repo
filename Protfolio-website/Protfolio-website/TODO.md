# TODO: Update Website for Borad Disha (Beginner Developer)

## Information Gathered
- Resume data from "Borad Disha.pdf": Personal details (name, contact, address, etc.), career objective, education (SSC, HSC, College), strengths, skills (creativity, teamwork, communication, basic computer knowledge), hobbies, and declaration.
- Current website is for Varad Bhogayata (experienced developer). Need to tailor for a beginner: simplify content, remove complex sections, focus on basics.
- Key changes: Update personal info, simplify about/experience/projects, update skills/education/contact, remove advanced elements.

## Plan
1. **Update Meta Tags and Title**: Change title to "Borad Disha | Beginner Developer", update description, Open Graph, etc.
2. **Intro Section**: Change name, typing text to beginner-focused (e.g., "Aspiring Developer", "Learner").
3. **About Section**: Rewrite to reflect career objective, strengths, as a beginner. Remove advanced tech details.
4. **Experience Section**: Since fresher, minimize or remove; add a note about being a fresher seeking opportunities.
5. **Projects Section**: Remove complex projects; add simple placeholders or remove section entirely for beginners.
6. **Skills Section**: Update to match resume: Creativity, Teamwork, Communication, Basic Computer Knowledge. Simplify categories.
7. **Education Section**: Update to her SSC, HSC, and college details.
8. **Contact Section**: Update phone, email, remove or update social links (no GitHub/LinkedIn mentioned, so remove or placeholder).
9. **Resume Link**: Change to her PDF path.
10. **Other**: Remove certifications, simplify navigation if needed. Ensure content is beginner-friendly.

## Dependent Files to Edit
- `index.html`: Main file to edit with all sections.

## Followup Steps
- After edits, test the website locally to ensure changes render correctly.
- Verify all personal data is updated accurately.
- If needed, add a profile image (currently using Varad's; replace with placeholder or default).
- Confirm with user for any additional tweaks.
