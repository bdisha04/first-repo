        <h1>Key Features:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Oyster Case:</b> Introduced in 1926, the Oyster case was the first waterproof wristwatch case, setting a standard for
                durability and protection against the elements. </li>
            <li><b>Perpetual Movement:</b> Rolex's self-winding movement, the Perpetual, harnesses the energy of the wearer's wrist movements
                to power the watch, eliminating the need for manual winding. </li>
            <li><b>Materials:</b> Rolex utilizes high-quality materials like Oystersteel, a highly corrosion-resistant alloy, and Everose 
                gold, a proprietary rose gold alloy, to ensure durability and aesthetic appeal. </li>
            <li><b>Cerachrom Bezels:</b> Many Rolex Professional models feature Cerachrom bezels, made of a highly scratch-resistant and 
                color-stable ceramic, ensuring the bezel retains its appearance even under harsh conditions. </li>
