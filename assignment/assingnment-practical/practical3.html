    <p>Rohtang Pass is a high mountain pass in the eastern Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas, located about
        51 km (32 miles) from Manali, Himachal Pradesh. At an elevation of 3,978 meters (13,051 feet),
        it connects the Kullu Valley with the Lahaul and Spiti Valleys. The name "Rohtang" translates to
        "ground of corpses" or "pile of dead bodies" in Ladakhi, reflecting the pass's historical reputation
        for treacherous conditions and fatalities during attempts to cross it. </p>
