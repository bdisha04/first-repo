    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 40px;">Rohtangpass</h1>

    <p style="text-align: center;">Rohtang Pass is a high mountain pass in the eastern Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas, located about 51 km from Manali in Himachal Pradesh.<br> <br>
    <strong>Geography and Location:</strong>
    Rohtang Pass is situated on the Pir Panjal Range, a part of the Himalayas. It connects the Kullu Valley with the Lahaul and Spiti valleys, providing access to these remote regions. The pass is at a high altitude of 3,978 meters (13,051 feet). <br> <br>
    <strong>History and Name:</strong>
    The name "Rohtang" translates to "pile of corpses" in Ladakhi, reflecting the pass's treacherous past when many travelers perished attempting to cross it due to unpredictable weather and challenging conditions. It has historically been an important trade route. The Atal Tunnel, a 8.8 km long tunnel, was built at a lower elevation to provide all-weather access to the region, bypassing the pass. <br> <br>
    <strong>Accessibility and Restrictions:</strong>
    Rohtang Pass is typically open for vehicular traffic from May to November, depending on weather conditions. It is closed during the winter months due to heavy snowfall and potential landslides. A permit is required to travel to Rohtang Pass, and there are restrictions on the number of vehicles allowed each day to control pollution and traffic congestion. </p>
