            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding: 2px 10px ; text-align: justify;">D. Gukesh, born on May 29, 2006, in Chennai, India, is a Grandmaster and the youngest-ever World Chess Champion. He is the second Indian to win the FIDE World Championship, following Viswanathan Anand, and also the youngest winner of the Candidates Tournament. His journey in chess began at the age of seven, and he quickly rose through the ranks, demonstrating exceptional talent and dedication. Gukesh was introduced to chess by his school coach, Mr. Bhaskar, at the age of seven. He later trained under Mr. Vijayanand and is currently part of the WestBridge Anand Chess Academy. He holds the record for being the youngest player to surpass a 2700 Elo rating, achieving 2750. In 2024, he became the youngest winner of the FIDE Candidates Tournament, and later that year, he defeated Ding Liren to become the youngest World Chess Champion at the age of 18. Gukesh's parents, Dr. Rajinikanth and Dr. Padma, are an ENT surgeon and a microbiologist, respectively. His family hails from Andhra Pradesh, but he was raised in Chennai. Gukesh's father has been instrumental in his career, even quitting his job to travel with him to tournaments. He has also received guidance from top-level coaches and is part of the WestBridge Anand Chess Academy. </p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Gukesh D became the youngest World Chess Champion by defeating Ding Liren in the final game of the 2024 championship.</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding: 2px 10px ; text-align: justify;">The era of Indian GM Gukesh Dommaraju as chess world champion has begun, after an incredibly hard-fought 2024 FIDE World Championship in Singapore suddenly ended when the Chinese reigning champion GM Ding Liren blundered in the final classical game. We take a look at some of the conclusions we can draw from an event that may prove to be a turning point in chess history. The winning moment came after a surprising blunder by Ding, where he moved his rook to the wrong square in the 14th game, ultimately leading to his resignation. Gukesh, initially expecting a draw and tiebreaks, capitalized on the mistake, securing his victory and the title. India’s D Gukesh beat China’s Ding Liren in Singapore on Thursday to become the youngest World Chess Championship in history. India’s D Gukesh beat China’s Ding Liren in Singapore on Thursday to become the youngest World Chess Championship in history. It was a tantalising 14-day affair between the reigning champion and Gukesh, before the latter came out on top.</p>
