Loop
A loop is a programming language that is used to reapeat no of iteration again and again

Why do we use loops?
1) iterating through collection:
2) repeating a task:
3) efficiency:

Types of loop:
1) For loop
2) While loop
3) Do while loop
4) For in loop
5) For of loop
6) For each loop
1) For loop: the for loop is used when you know the exact number of times you want to repeat a block of code.
	
Syntax: for (initialization; condition; update) {
		// code to be execute
		}

-->initialization: you deine and initialize a variable that controls the loop.
-->condition: this is a test expression that is evaluate before each iteration the condition is true.

example:


2) While loop: While loop runs as long as the given condition is true

Syntax: while (condition)
	{
		//code to be executed
		//updation
	}

example:


3) Do while loop: the loop is similar to the while loop, but the key difference is that the condition is checked after the code is executed.
		  do wile be executed once time either true or false after check 

Syntax: do
	{
		//code to be executed
	} while (condition);

example:


4) For in loop: the loop is specifically used for iterating over objects (not arrays).
		on each iteration, the key variable holds the name of the current property.

Syntax: let key in person 

example:


5) For of loop:  the loop is used t lo through values in an itrable (like an aray, sring or other iterable object)

Syntax:
 

6) for each loop: foreach is a loop that can be convert any array as its list

Syntax:
